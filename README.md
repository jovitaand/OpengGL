# OpengGL
I have successfully completed the animation of village scenario with several stationary and moving components with the OpenGL tool implemented in CodeBlocks. OpenGL supports enormous flexibility in the design and the use of OpenGL graphics programs. The presence of many built in classes methods take care of much functionality and reduce the job of coding as well as makes the implementation simpler. We have implemented the project making it user-friendly and error free as possible.
